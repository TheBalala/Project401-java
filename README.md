# Conflict

## What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?<br>

 We will try to prevent the occurrence of conflicts by approving on the same point before rushing into work, but If we had any conflicts, we will go with logic and democracy, we will go with best sound opinion and try to convince the other side in a logical manner.

&nbsp;

## What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?<br>

First, we will open up with him/her, Communication is the best in such situations, if this did not work, we will try to support our point by doing some prototypes of our work and share it with him/her, so they can judge if the project can be done by us all.

&nbsp;

## How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?<br>

We will try to review each others code in a daily manner so when can keep up with the functionality and the design of th project, each one of us can make a list and write down the parts he/she did not understand on others code, then search them out, this will make us all aware of the functionality of the project

&nbsp;

## How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?<br>

I will assign more tasks for him/her, and set deadline for that task.

&nbsp;

## How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?<br>

When we would have tried everything to reach into a solution.

&nbsp;

Voting on each critical decision is the way.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Work

We will create a workspace on Trello, each member will have tasks assigned by his name, each task will have  a deadline.

&nbsp;

Trello.

&nbsp;

# Git

## What components of your project will live on GitHub?<br>

We will have two repos on our project:

* a frot-end repo that will render the app itself and it will retrive its data from the back-end repo.
* a back-end repo that will be the API (server) that will work with a third party API and a database so we can supply the app with the needed data at any time.

&nbsp;

## How will you share the repository with your teammates?<br>

We created a Github organization and all of us are owners so we can share and contribute the work.

&nbsp;


## What is your Git flow?<br>

We will take a sub branch from the main branch and call it "staging" then each one of us will make a new branch for every task he/she will work on.

&nbsp;


## Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider

###  How many people must review a PR?

The team leader will review the code and check if there are any problems or bugs before merging it.
###  Who merges PRs?

The team leader will approve the pull requests once reviewing it.

###  How often will you merge?

on a daily basis

###  How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
